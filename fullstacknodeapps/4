Demo - Deconstructing Hello World
=================================

- Every request made can be handled by a function with req/res
- We could apply multiple functions over those req/res objects
- By adding a 'next' parameter, we can chain those functions
- Well done, we've now invented 'connect'

  function handler(req, res, next) {

  }

npm install 'connect'
